# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The Pandas library in Jupyter notebook is used to clean data and perform exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
 PostgreSQL with AWS cloud is used for the database requirement.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library will be used to create a classifier. We will use agglomerative clustering of unsupervised machine learning which are "K-means clustering" and "hierarchical clustering" algorithm in this project.
Our training and testing will be split up into a 70:30 ratio. 

## Dashboard
Tableau tool will be used for the visualization for the final results.
