# FinalProject
 
# Segment 1
## Notes from Module
**Before meeting with your instructor, your team will need to complete the following:**  
1. Decide on a topic, source data, and perform exploratory data analysis.  
   * Think of a question that can be answered using data.  
2. Create a repository and establish individual branches for each team member.DONE
3. Create a mockup of a machine learning model.
4. Create a mockup of a database.HINA
   * Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
   * Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
5. Decide which technologies will be used.

## Team Roles
**Square:** The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.  
**Triangle:** The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.  
**Circle:** The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.  
**X:** The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.

## Components/Requirements
### Presentation (30 points)
The team members have drafted their project, including the following:  
- Selected topic  
- Reason they selected the topic  
- Description of the source of data  
- Questions they hope to answer with the data  
Doesn't need to be a presentation, can be a README.ms file only

### GitHub Repository (10 points)
**Main Branch:** The main branch should include The README.md with a description of the communication protocols  
**Individual Branches:** At least 1 branch per member with at least four commits each for the duration of the first segment  

### Machine Learning Model (35 points)
Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:  
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label for input data

### Database Integration (25 points)
Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:  
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema  
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database
