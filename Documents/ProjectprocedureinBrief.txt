Steps:

1)Python and its libraries will be used to clean, prepare, and explore the data: 
1)Load the csv in a dataframe.
2)check for duplicates.
3)check for NAN values.
4)eleminate Reduntant data.
5)Convert any column data type according to the need of the end result.
6)Divide the dataframe into further different dataframe as per the requirement, these dataframe will represent as inidividual table in the database.
7)Any changes made or files added will be placed in the github final project folder.

2)Cleaned data stored in S3 AWS technology platform as storage repo using Postgres SQL:
1)wrte the SQL or Schema for each table structure for each potential dataframes.
2)create entries for each table. Modify the data if required in postgres from the local machine.
3)Export each table as csv and place in github for further need.

3)machine learning implemention procedure:
1)Retreive the data from the storage using the SQL functions.
2)Join or merge the database if required and store it in a different dataframe.
3)prepare the data for machine learning. Since we will use both the Kmeans algorithm and Hierarchical clustering each step below will be repeated for both the type of models with minimal or any changes required.
1)Prepare the model.
2)prepare the training data .
3)Fit the model.
4)measure the accuracy.
5)plot the graph.
6)Final observation and analysis.

7)future enhancement
UI to be implemented with the user chosen data.
