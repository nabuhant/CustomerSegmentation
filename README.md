Proposed findings and a hypothesis of results (i.e. business problem contextualized with data driven results)  

## Github repo and everyone has merged with the main branch at least once  
- To clone the new repo  
git clone url :- replace url with the project url  
- Creating a new Branch and pushing the code in the branch.  
git branch branchname  
git branch :- To check the available branches. * indicates the branch we r currently in.  
git checkout branchname :- switch to given branchName  
git add . :- add the files  
git commit -m "Add the comments" :- commit the code with appropriate comments.  
git push -u origin branchname :- replace branch name with the actual branch name.  
- Check that staus before merginging into main, if required use pull request and than merge.

### Database Storage
PostgreSQL with AWS cloud is used for the database requirement.
#### Database Mock Up (Preferably a ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram)  

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library will be used to create a classifier. We will use agglomerative clustering of unsupervised machine learning which are "K-means clustering" and "hierarchical clustering" algorithm in this project.
Our training and testing will be split up into a 70:30 ratio.
